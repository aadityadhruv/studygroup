# StudyMates


#### About:

StudyMates is a cross platform chat app built using React Native for creating and joining study groups. 

With this app, you can find and create study groups based on the classes you are enrolled in. 

All your chats and messages will be stored offline too.

#### Features

Study groups are public, and anyone can join them. You can add and leave study groups as you want.

You can also privately chat with any member in a group you are a part of by simply clicking on that person's name. 
 
 If someone suspicious messages you privately, you can block them with a single click.

On the Homescreen, recommended groups will be suggested for you based on your class selection.

You can edit your profile to change your name and the classes you are enrolled in.

The app will cache your data to an offline database so that you can access your chats when you do not have interent connection.


#### Details:


This app is mainly built using JavaScript and ReactNative. The app uses Firebase & Firestore to store all the users' and groups' data, as well as for authentication.

To store the data offline, it uses a offline SQL database.



### Future plans:

We plan to add image support and more administrative power to group admins.
